<p><a href="https://github.com/HummaWhite/Zillum">Zillum</a> is my ray tracer, under development since I seriously began to study realistic image synthesis in Sep 2020. Now it has two versions, one running on CPU, another on GPU, which is also named <a href="https://github.com/HummaWhite/ZillumGL">ZillumGL</a>.
Iâ€™ve made two videos about the GPU version, you can view them through the links:</p>
