<p>My interest for computer graphics was not developed at all until February 2020. Before that, I roughly spent half of my junior year working on ACM-ICPC training, planning to be admitted to UESTC ACM-ICPC Team and continue my OI (Olympiad in Informatics, like a high school version of ACM-ICPC) career-which eventually failed.</p>

<p>Quitting ACM-ICPC in July 2019 freed me from endless training and midnight CodeForces rounds (the last one I attended was #574, how fast the time goes!), so I had bountiful time to concentrate on my coursework in the next semester, during which I systematically learned C++ as my main programming language. The final project of our C++ course was to make a sprite game using important features of C++, and I made a very simplified duplicate of A Link to the Past (Zelda fan I am!), with approximately 2000 lines of core code. It was the first 'big' project I programmed and I really enjoyed coding it.</p>
