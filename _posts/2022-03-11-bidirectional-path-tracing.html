	Unweighted contribution, MIS weight (power heuristic), and weighted contribution

<p>The visualized MIS weights supported my earlier hypothesis that direct caustics in BDPT is mostly contributed by light tracing (t=1 case). And to my surprise, it even contributes considerably to indirect illumination of diffuse surfaces.</p>

	Comparison with path tracing and light tracing. Each rendered in 20 minutes, with fixed tracing depth=10

<p>While BDPT can handle LS+DE and LDS+E paths, which path tracer and light tracer cannot handle respectively, SDS paths still remains an obstacle: the walls which appear in bunny's specular surface do not have caustics! (first S: bunny's surface, second S: delta light. By the way, I didn't actually implement delta light, I used a tiny area light and a paraboloid mirror to approximate one)</p>

<p>Maybe the solution to rendering SDS paths lies in density estimation methods, so it's time to learn more about the photon mapping family... </p>
