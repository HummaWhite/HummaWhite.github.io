My interest for computer graphics was not developed at all until February 2020. Before that, I roughly spent half of my junior year working on ACM-ICPC training, planning to be admitted to UESTC ACM-ICPC Team and continue my OI (Olympiad in Informatics, like a high school version of ACM-ICPC) career-which eventually failed.

Quitting ACM-ICPC in July 2019 freed me from endless training and midnight CodeForces rounds (the last one I attended was #574, how fast the time goes!), so I had bountiful time to concentrate on my coursework in the next semester, during which I systematically learned C++ as my main programming language. The final project of our C++ course was to make a sprite game using important features of C++, and I made a very simplified duplicate of A Link to the Past (Zelda fan I am!), with approximately 2000 lines of core code. It was the first 'big' project I programmed and I really enjoyed coding it.

After the project, it came to the time to select courses for the next semester. There was an elective cource '3D Graphics Programming', to teach students OpenGL and 3D graphics. I thought this course would be helpful-if I would want to try making other mini games in 3D later, such as a self-made Minecraft. But later when I searched on web to discover more about this course, I found out from some past students' project reports of this course-that the course wasn't to teach much about graphics. The most complex scene they made was simply a box with a ball and a cone in it. With no realistic lighting, shadow and reflection, this could not meet my expectation. So I decided to learn on my own for 3D programming.
